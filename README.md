# PhotoCube

**Photo cube** is a small html+css+js file built with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).
It displays a series of picture in a web page, for quick/fun browsing.

Pictures must be located in imgCube/variable/ directory and named img1.jpg to img{number of pics}.jpg.
In index.html line 82, variable imgNb must be set to {number of pics}.

[See the example](http://oscar6echo.github.com/PhotoCube/).

To publish a photocube, place the
	index.html file
 	js/ directory
  	imgCub/ directory containing the pictures in the variable/ directory
in
	a github repo. Then publish it with gh-pages. Many ways to do it [here](http://oli.jp/2011/github-pages-workflow/).
	a dropbox public folder. Then copy the public link and email it to your audience.
